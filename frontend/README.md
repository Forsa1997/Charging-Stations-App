1 As User I want to see a welcome page, when I visit the main URL, so that I know what the application does.
2 As User I want to be able to create an account and login so that I can see my user information.
3 As User I want a Button, that quickly moves me to my current position so I donÂ´t need to write my position in the searchbar.
4 As User I want a Navbar visible at all times, that helps me to navigate the web page.
